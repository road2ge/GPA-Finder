# GPA-finder

One day, I was doing one of my projects, and I wondered what my GPA was.  Unfortunately, my school's administrators
had decided that the GPA functionality provided with Powerschool (our school's stupid gradebook system, which is only
useful because I can see my grades when I want to, if it's not down, which happens frequently).  So, dear old me went
to the great Google gods and found a weighted gpa list for South Carolina and then plugged and chugged into my calculator.
I then decided that I wanted to know this quicker and wanted to make a Python script for myself.  Then, I remembered something
in my development class that it's easier to keep things general so that it can apply to other things, and I thought of my cousin
in Charlotte and decided I should make it at least a little global, and such that I could apply it to other state's GPA system.
Of course, I'm too lazy to do this for my cousin, who would struggle to setup Python for himself, but I just threw this together
anyway.  I think it's nice, and if you don't, you're welcome to make one yourself.
